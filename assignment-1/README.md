In the classic Asteroids game, you steer a ship in space, clearing it of asteroids. Asteroids are destroyed by shooting them, and if your ship collides with an asteroid, it is destroyed. Imaginary spaceship construction has improved since the 80s. Now the hulls can withstand a collision and it is the easiest way to destroy the asteroids. Your spaceship will be drawn with several filled polygons, at least one of which should be concave. The spaceship must only accelerate in the direction it is pointing, so it must be able to rotate. Control the spaceship with keys. Asteroids should bounce off the boundaries of the display. New asteroids should spawn at regular or random intervals, with 0 to many on screen at the same time. How the game is scored is up to you, but a score must be visible (in the console as a last resort). At least collisions should cause a sound effect.
