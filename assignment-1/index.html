      <p>
        In the classic Asteroids game, you steer a ship in space, clearing it of
        asteroids. Asteroids are destroyed by shooting them, and if your ship
        collides with an asteroid, it is destroyed. Imaginary spaceship
        construction has improved since the 80s. Now the hulls can withstand a
        collision and it is the easiest way to destroy the asteroids. Your
        spaceship will be drawn with several filled polygons, at least one of
        which should be concave. The spaceship must only accelerate in the
        direction it is pointing, so it must be able to rotate. Control the
        spaceship with keys. Asteroids should bounce off the boundaries of the
        display. New asteroids should spawn at regular or random intervals, with
        0 to many on screen at the same time. How the game is scored is up to
        you, but a score must be visible (in the console as a last resort). At
        least collisions should cause a sound effect.
